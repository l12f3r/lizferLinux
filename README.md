# lizferLinux
Provisioning of a Wordpress website implementation on cloud based on a server with LAMP (Linux üêß, Apache2 üñåÔ∏è, MySQL üê¨ and PHP üêò). Check it at http://188.166.90.196 / http://lizfer.com.

I decided to create a personal space where I could demonstrate my Linux system administration skills. The prerrogative was:
- This space needs to be operational anytime, anywhere (availability); and
- it must meet minimal performance standards (reliability).


## 1. Linux machine

### 1.a: Provisioning the cloud machine

The first step was provisioning an instance (that is, a _droplet_) at Digital Ocean. My pick was Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, hosted at Amsterdam (default-ams3).

After having the instance ready (with my SSH public and private keys properly installed), the next step was configuring the server to have the LAMP setup installed. 

First things first: `ssh root@188.166.90.196` into it, then `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade`. Now, good practices: create a regular user and stop using the root account.

### 1.b: User creation and authentication

This was pretty straightforward: 

1. Ran `adduser lizfer` and created the PID 1000 user; 
2. Added it to the sudoers group using `usermod -aG sudo lizfer`;
3. Allowed it to use the SSH public key by copying it from root (and granted ownership of this copy) using rsync: `rsync --archive --chown=lizfer:lizfer ~/.ssh /home/lizfer`. 

At this point, my newly-created user had administrative privileges whenever it used `sudo` and I could use this account to access from any remote client that had the SSH private key installed.

### 1.c: Firewall

Although this was a simple demonstration, it's always good practice to have a firewall set, to avoid undesired connections. Since that this is an Ubuntu machine, I used UFW. To enable it, I just had to enter `ufw enable`. As other software are installed, description on firewall settings will be added.


## 2. Apache2

From this moment onwards, I decided to authenticate using the PID 1000 account (lizfer) for testing reasons - hence why lots of `sudo` will appear.

Configuring the "A" in LAMP was a handful of work - my first attempt was configuring a Nginx web server, but conflicts with php-fpm and cacheing prevented me from doing so. 

### 2.a: Downloading

The first step was getting Apache2 from Ubuntu's repos using `sudo apt install apache2`. Just had to accept the installation terms.

### 2.b: Firewall settings

By downloading Apache, UFW automatically creates profiles for Apache based on ports available for access. By entering `sudo ufw app list`, the list of available applications was prompted on the stdout (tl;dr: **Apache** profile opens only port 80, **Apache Full** opens both port 80 and port 443 and **Apache Secure** opens only port 443):

    Available applications:
      Apache
      Apache Full
      Apache Secure
      OpenSSH

To configure the TLS/SSL certificate for Wordpress, I allowed communication in ports 80 and 443 by enabling the **Apache Full** profile: `sudo ufw allow in "Apache Full"`.


## 3. MySQL

It might look scary at first, but setting up a database was not that difficult due to Ubuntu's configuration.

### 3.a: Download and configuration

Just had to use `sudo apt install mysql-server` to start downloading. Once completed, I ran `sudo mysql_secure_installation` to configure it using MySQL's security script:
- For the `VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN`, I set a MySQL root password with `STRONG` length (security should always be strong, IMHO);
- Disabled root account access from a remote client (outside of the local host);
- Removed anonymous user pre-set accounts;
- Removed the test database, and privileges that allow access to databases with names starting with "test_". 

Setting up a MySQL root password was extremely cautious, since that the default authentication method for root is using a unix_socket. 

### 3.b: Creating user and database for Wordpress

Wordpress saves information on a database to manage the website and information. I created a new database and user for security reasons (the same ones why I created the PID 1000 user).

- First, I entered as root using `mysql -u root -p`;
- Created the `wordpress` database using `CREATE DATABASE wordpress DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;`;
- Created the `lizfer` user with `CREATE USER 'lizfer'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'psswd';` (`'psswd'` is not the real password, obviously);
- Granted full access on `wordpress` to `lizfer`: `GRANT ALL ON wordpress.* TO 'lizfer'@'%';` and updated MySQL's privileges using `FLUSH PRIVILEGES`.


## 4. PHP

PHP installation by itself is not enough: I also installed several other packages, such as `php-mysql` (module that allows PHP to communicate with MySQL) and `libapache2-mod-php` (to enable Apache to handle PHP files), for example:

`sudo apt install php php-mysql libapache2-mod-php php-curl php-gd php-mbstring php-xml php-xmlrpc php-soap php-intl php-zip`.

At this point, the LAMP stack was already installed and I had a production instance working.


## 5. Pre-Wordpress Configuration

This chapter is reserved for configuration that must be applied before installing Wordpress.

### 5.a: Apache's Virtual Host configuration

*I decided to use this machine for hosting more than one domain. Therefore, the configuration of an Apache Virtual Host was necessary. Data is displayed as `lizfer` but this is a placeholder - upon provisioning a new domain for this machine, the proper data must be used.*

The default `/var/www/html` directory remained as backup for the original files; I created a new folder under `www` (`sudo mkdir /var/www/lizfer`) and assigned its ownership to the PID 1000 user (`sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/lizfer`).

Then, I created a new configuration file under Apache structure using Nano: `sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/lizfer.conf` and included the following content in it:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName lizfer
    ServerAlias www.lizfer.com
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    DocumentRoot /var/www/lizfer
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} =www.lizfer.com [OR]
RewriteCond %{SERVER_NAME} =lizfer
RewriteRule ^ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [END,NE,R=permanent]
<Directory /var/www/lizfer/>
    AllowOverride All
</Directory>    
</VirtualHost>
```

I used `sudo a2ensite lizfer` to instruct Apache which is the current active server, and disabled the default website using `sudo a2dissite 000-default`. Ran the final configuration test with `sudo apache2ctl configtest` (with a `Syntax OK` response) and rebooted the instance.

### 5.b: Domain acquisition and configuration

I acquired the [lizfer.com](http://lizfer.com) domain on [Google Domains](http://domains.google.com) ("Why?" you ask. "Billing" is the answer) and set it to route to my droplet's IP address:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22382891/132994949-66f7c648-4a82-4759-93ac-622c7ea85c84.png)

### 5.c: CA configuration

This process was added because WordPress deals with personal data, which requires some TLS/SSL security. For the Certificate Authority, I chose [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) because it automatizes most processes with Certbot and it easily integrates with Apache. A few more sub-steps:

- Installed the `certbot` and `python3-certbot-apache` (integration between Apache and Certbot) packages: `sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache`;
- Used the Apache plugin for Certbot to set up authentication and installation: `sudo certbot --apache` 

Then, up to configuring Wordpress! üöÄ


## 6. Wordpress

### 6.a: Download and extraction

As a good practice, the latest Wordpress version should be downloaded straight from their website using `curl`.

- First: moved to a writable, temporary directory: `cd /tmp`
- Downloaded using `curl -O https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz`;
- Extracted the file using `tar xzvf latest.tar.gz`;
- Created a dummy .htaccess file for Wordpress: `touch /tmp/wordpress/.htaccess` and copied the sample config file for the Wordpress to read: `cp /tmp/wordpress/wp-config-sample.php /tmp/wordpress/wp-config.php`;
- Avoided future Wordpress permission issues upon updating by creating an upgrade directory: `mkdir /tmp/wordpress/wp-content/upgrade`;
- Copied the whole content of the directory to Apache's directory: `sudo cp -a /tmp/wordpress/. /var/www/lizfer/`;
- Granted ownership to www-data (user and group) on Apache's directory: `sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/lizfer`;
- Set proper permissions on Wordpress folders using `find`: `sudo find /var/www/lizfer/ -type d -exec chmod 750 {} \;` and 
`sudo find /var/www/lizfer/ -type f -exec chmod 640 {} \;`.

### 6.b: Security

Upon configuring, Wordpress requires to adjust some secret keys:

- Obtained random values from Wordpress' secret key generator using `curl -s https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/`;
- Entered the proper values on Wordpress' config file using nano: `sudo nano /var/www/lizfer/wp-config.php`.
